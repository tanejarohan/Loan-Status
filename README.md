Loan Status Prediction
This project focuses on analyzing loan approval data to predict whether a loan will be approved based on applicant details. The dataset includes key features such as Loan ID, Gender, Marital Status, Dependents, Education, Employment Type, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, and Property Area. To ensure data quality, thorough data cleaning was performed, followed by univariate and bivariate analysis to uncover meaningful insights. For predictive modeling, Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms were implemented to classify loan approvals with high accuracy. This project provides valuable insights into loan eligibility criteria, helping financial institutions and applicants make informed decisions. ðŸš€
